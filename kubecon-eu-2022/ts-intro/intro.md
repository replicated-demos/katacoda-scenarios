## Why We're Here

Kubernetes has revolutionized the tech industry by drastically reducing costs, time, & resources needed to deploy applications. The Open Source PaaS can be customized to meet the needs of almost any organization - which is awesome, but can also cause a lot of headaches when it comes to compatibility with *your* app.

Fortunately, Replicated comes to the rescue with a framework of Kubernetes tools that takes all of the guesswork out of verifying, diagnosing, & resolving issues in client environments called `troubleshoot.sh`. Join us for a **fully interactive** demo of the `troubleshoot.sh` framework, an extremely powerful but easy-to-use tool for getting your clients up & running.
