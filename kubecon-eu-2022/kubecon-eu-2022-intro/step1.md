Founded in 2015 by Marc Campbell and Grant Miller, Replicated seeks to modernize on-prem software for the cloud-native era by providing commercial and open source tools to streamline the distribution including (but certainly not limited to):

- [Troubleshoot](http://troubleshoot.sh/): a framework for collecting, redacting, and analyzing highly customizable diagnostic information about a Kubernetes cluster.

## Introduction to Troubleshoot.sh

**Troubleshoot** by Replicated is an Open Source framework for collecting, redacting, and analyzing highly customizable diagnostic information about a Kubernetes cluster. 

The framework is accessed via two plugins: `preflight` & `support-bundle`. `Preflight` provides pre-installation cluster conformance testing and validation and `support-bundle` provides post-installation troubleshooting and diagnostics.

To further improve the user experience, Replicated developed a supplementary tool for easier reading of `support-bundle` output, named Support Bundle Control. `sbctl` is a sort of virtual cluster that reads the bundles generated by `support-bundle` for post-installation troubleshooting and diagnostics.

Let's take a tour of `troubleshoot.sh` in this interactive demo. 

While our environment is warming up, let's introduce today's speakers.
