Founded in 2015 by Marc Campbell and Grant Miller, Replicated seeks to modernize on-prem software for the cloud-native era by providing commercial and open source tools to streamline the distribution including (but certainly not limited to):

- [kURL](http://kurl.sh/): a CNCF certified Kubernetes installer for creating custom k8s distros that can be shared via `cURL` URLS or as downloadable packages. 
- [KOTS (Kubernetes off-the-shelf) software](https://kots.io/): a `kubectl` plugin & admin console that helps manage preflight, install, support & upgrade of 3rd-party K8s software
- [SchemaHero](https://schemahero.io): an open-source database schema migration tool that converts a schema definition into migration scripts that can be applied in any environment. 
- [Troubleshoot](http://troubleshoot.sh/): a framework for collecting, redacting, and analyzing highly customizable diagnostic information about a Kubernetes cluster.

## Introduction to Troubleshoot.sh

**Troubleshoot** by Replicated is an Open Source framework for collecting, redacting, and analyzing highly customizable diagnostic information about a Kubernetes cluster. 

The framework is accessed via two plugins: `preflight` & `support-bundle`. `Preflight` provides pre-installation cluster conformance testing and validation and `support-bundle` provides post-installation troubleshooting and diagnostics.

To further improve the user experience, Replicated developed a supplementary tool for easier access to `support-bundle` output, named Support Bundle Control or `sbctl` for short. `sbctl` is a sort of virtual cluster that reads the bundles generated by `support-bundle` for post-installation troubleshooting and diagnostics.

Let's take a tour of `troubleshoot.sh` in this interactive demo. 

While our environment is warming up, let's introduce today's speakers.
