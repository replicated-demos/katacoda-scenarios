## Why We're Here

Kubernetes has revolutionized the tech industry by drastically reducing costs, time, & resources needed to deploy applications. The Open Source PaaS can be customized to meet the needs of almost any organization - which is awesome, but can also cause a lot of headaches when it comes to compatibility with *your* app.

## Prerequisites

* The vscode requires port `23000` to be opened on the firewall, if you don't have the port open you can use your local editor to edit.

* Sense of curiorisity, throughout this scenario be curious and keep thinking why some things are the way they are, it will hopefully make sense at the end.
